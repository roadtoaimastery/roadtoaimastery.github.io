If I had 1 hour to learn Linear Algebra, we would go top-down approach to get rough understanding of what it is. The following prompt will get you a very good overview first, then gradually diving into details, without overwhelming with technical details!

## Step 1: Ask ChatGPT for Overview

<div class="chatgpt-prompt" markdown="0">
You are a math professor in Pure Mathematics.

What's linear algebra? Summarize the essence in 2-3 sentences. List 2-3 applications that uses key concepts from Linear Algebra. 

Explain what the application is, why it's useful, and how linear algebra concept is used
</div>

## Step 2: Ask Chat GPT for Cheat Sheet

<div class="chatgpt-prompt" markdown="0">
You are a top student from Stanford Maths undergrad. 

Create a 1-page cheat seat for linear algebra course. 

It should include a bullet point per key concept, and key equations. Make sure concepts for following applications are included: (what professor said above)
</div>

## Step 3: Ask for Step-by-Step walkthrough of the applications

<div class="chatgpt-prompt" markdown="0">

break it down step-by-step,  describing how concepts from the cheat sheet is applied. 

Explain it to my 10 year old nephew. Do not miss a step.
